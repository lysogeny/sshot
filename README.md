# sshot
SSHot! Use ssh to upload a screenshot to your server! 

## Requirements
Requires *xsel*, *scrot* and *ssh*. 

## Setup
While there is a basic setup script all it will do is copy sshot to your `~/bin`, and give your server your public ssh key.
Before you run the script I recommend you edit the variables in `sshot.sh` to match your preferred configuration.
You should also install `xsel` and `scrot` if you don't have them already.
